# Task 2 – Library Management System (SQL DML Operations)

This project contains SQL scripts to demonstrate Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations as part of a Library Management System. It covers inserting, updating, deleting data, and handling `NULL` values in a multi-table relational database.

##  Objectives

- Insert sample data into related tables (Authors, Books, Members, BorrowRecords)
- Modify records using `UPDATE`
- Delete data conditionally using `DELETE`
- Handle `NULL`, `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `UNIQUE`, and `FOREIGN KEY` constraints

##  Data Overview

- Sample authors: Chetan Bhagat, Arundhati Roy, Amish Tripathi
- Sample books: *Five Point Someone*, *The God of Small Things*, *The Immortals of Meluha*
- Sample members: Nikita Patil, Kamini Chaudhari, Bhagyashri Patil
- Borrow records showing book issuance and return tracking

## SQL Features Used

- `INSERT INTO`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Use of `NULL` values in optional fields
- `AUTO_INCREMENT` for primary keys
- `FOREIGN KEY` constraints for table relationships

## Tools

- MySQL / SQLite (via DB Fiddle, SQLiteStudio, or local setup)

## Files

- `task2.sql` – SQL script with all DML operations
- `README.md` – Project overview and task documentation

## Submission

This task is part of the SQL Developer Internship Program – Task 2: Data Insertion and Null Handling.
